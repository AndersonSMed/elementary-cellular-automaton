# elementary-cellular-automaton
A project was created as a way to visually understand [elementary cellular automatons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) and how they work

## Running locally
To run this project locally is extremely easy, you need to create a simple HTTP server to serve the static files

[Example of how to create a simple server with Python](https://realpython.com/python-http-server/)

Alternatively, you can access the project page

## Parameters

Once you access the page, there are some parameters in the UI that can be changed to create different kinds of visualizations, below is a list of them

| Parameter | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Variant | Default | Varying the colors of the visualization |
| Rule number | 150 | The rule enables different kinds of patterns in the visualization, [here's a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton#Random_initial_state) of all the 256 possible rules |
| Square size | 10 | The size in pixels of the generated squares |
| Elements per line | 100 | The amount of squares generated per line |
